# Shadow Walker

This repository is an archive of a final project I was a party of during my BS degree program in 2010, at New England Institue of Technology (Warwick, RI).

## Project Team Members

- Joe Greathead, @joevgreathead (myself)
- Nathaniel Frappier, (username unknown)
- Craig Houle, (username unknown)

## Context

This project was scoped to be an original creation of ours using what we had learned in combination with any resources we found. It was not intended or meant for distribution and is posted here only as a record of work. Any resemblance to existing work is purely coincidental. All content was pulled from a hard copy CD that was a duplicate of one submitted for grading and duplicated/retained by other team members.

## License

No license is provided for the use of this code as the team members each share equal copyright privileges and distribution of the project was never intended.
This code should not be duplicated, used, distributed, or otherwise used in any way.
